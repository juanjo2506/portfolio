As a Full Stack Developer, I am capable of building a complete and functional website from scratch. I apply various tools, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, and MySQL. Currently, I am expanding my skill set by learning additional tools such as APIs and React.</p>

            <h3>Web Development</h3>
            <p>Thanks to all the skills and knowledge that I have acquired, I have recently become a full-stack developer. I am capable of building a website, including its functionalities, implementing CRUD operations, validations, a login and registration process, database integration, and APIs.</p>

            <h3>Frontend Skills</h3>
            <p>I'm able to design the visual aspects of the different sections that comprise a website, structuring it through HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Right now, I'm learning React in order to implement new features for future projects.</p>

            <h3>Backend Skills</h3>
            <p>Definitely what I like the most is the backend side. It's like bringing to life the project you are working on. In this case, I'm using JavaScript as the main tool. Then, I use Express, Node.js, MySQL, and everything in between. As additional packages, I utilize Sequelize, EJS, Multer, Express-session, and cookie-parser</p>

          <p class="">As you can see, some of these projects have two links: one of them is the direct link to the website, and the other one is the GitHub repository where it's saved. Right now, some of the projects are still in progress, so you will see changes over time, including the addition of new features and possibly some design changes. If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.</p>
